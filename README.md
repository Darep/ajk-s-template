ajk's template
==============

A starting point, a boilerplate, a template for your Web project. Mainly just provides a bunch of nice CSS/Sass things so you are ready to just roll. Main point is to promote smart modularity with CSS, so the project's CSS won't become a dump. Also tries to promote responsiveness and ems instead of pixels.

Check out the `sass`-directory and take a look around. If you like it, grab the template and start hacking! :)
